# Portfolio2

This is repository that has a dataset of a store. This data set has some information about products sold in January 2019. I explored the data first and I addressed some business issues using Python. These issues are:

1- Display and plot the daily sales to show which day has the higher sales.
2- Display and plot the items sold in ordered to show the highest product sold in January 2019.

To address these issues, I needed to check the null values. Then after I found there are few null values, I dropped them. Also, I added a column to display the days and extracted the day from the ordered date column. In addition, I added a column to display the daily sales.
I needed some packages such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and seaborn.
